**Social Network Analysis**

Proposed textbook: "Network Science" by Barabasi
(<http://networksciencebook.com/>). Only some chapters are covered --
see detailed materials on Absalon.

Slides will be provided on the course's website. Additional custom
readings will also be provided on the course's website when a subject is
not fully covered in the textbook.

**Structure**

The Network Analysis part of the ASDSI course consists of four lectures.
Each lecture will be divided into 1.5 hours (8:30 without a break or
8:15 with a 10 min. break) of introduction to new concepts, plus three
hours of exercise -- applications of the newly introduced concepts. The
course is organised around four main topical chapters. Each chapter is
presented from a historical perspective.

1.  **2023/03/13 Mon - Basic Graph Theory \[Sandro\]**

    1.  Motivation: What is Network Science, why is it relevant, and
        what examples?

    2.  Key concepts: Nodes & Links

    3.  Origins: Leonhard Euler - Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg (Path,
        Link directions, Connected components)

    4.  Network representation: Edge list, Adjacency matrix, Adding
        weights

    5.  Linear Algebra short recap: Vectors, Matrix, Matrix operations,
        Eigenvectors & eigenvalues

2.  **2023/03/15 Wed - Network identity card & Centrality \[Sandro\]**

    1.  Identity card Part 1: Nodes and edges, Unipartite/bipartite,
        Clustering coefficient, Shortest paths, Average path length,
        Diameter, Density

    2.  Identity card Part 2: Node degree, In-degree/ Out-degree,
        Weights

    3.  Network centrality: Degree centrality, Betweenness centrality,
        Eigenvector centrality

3.  **2023/03/20 Mon - Network statistical distributions \[Sandro\]**
